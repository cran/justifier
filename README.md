The goal of `justifier` is to provide a simple human- and
machine-readable standard for documenting justifications for decisions.
`justifier` was primarily developed to enable documenting the
development of behavior change interventions and the planning and
execution of scientific studies, but it can also be used to document
decisions in organisations, enabling deriving insights in decision
processes from the accumulation of decisions and types of justifications
over time.

Three vignettes (in progress) are located at:

-   <https://r-packages.gitlab.io/justifier/articles/general-introduction-to-justifier.html>
-   <https://r-packages.gitlab.io/justifier/articles/justifier-in-study-design.html>
-   <https://r-packages.gitlab.io/justifier/articles/justifier-in-intervention-development.html>

This meets the increasing demand for accountability of professionals
(see e.g.Â Van Woerkum & Aarts, 2012).
